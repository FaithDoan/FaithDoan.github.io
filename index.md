### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1 was one of my favorites because it introduced me to the world
    of judging the Olympics and its mechanics. Although I struggled with the 
    code, I was pleased when I was able to calculate the average score of any 
    given performance the same way a judge would.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was one of my favorites because Iâ€™ve always been fascinated 
    with the concept of vectors, and this lab gave me the perfect opportunity 
    to play around with them. Using vectors, I was able to organize and pull 
    information from a list of countries and their populations.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was one of my favorites because I love art and animation. 
    So, learning how create my own colored moving images using code excited me! 
    Using sin(), I created gifs and made it appear as if it were looping (using 
    the loop function).
